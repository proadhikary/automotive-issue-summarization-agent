# RAG for Summarization

## Goal
This project involves designing a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) based summarization agent. The agent is aimed at summarizing automotive issues using a provided dataset.

## Task
A language model (LLM) based summarization agent has been developed to summarize automotive issues from a given dataset. The agent accepts an input in the following JSON structure:

```json
Input = { 
  "make": "ford",
  "model": "escape",
  "year": "2001",
  "issue": "stuck throttle risk"
}
```

The agent retrieves relevant documents from the dataset based on the provided input and generates a summary of the issue using those documents. The output consists of both the retrieved documents and the final summary generated by the agent.

## Dataset
For this task, the NHTSA Recalls dataset was used. The dataset is available for download at NHTSA Recalls. The relevant dataset file, [FLAT_RCL.zip](https://www.nhtsa.gov/nhtsa-datasets-and-apis), contains the necessary columns for the task: `{make, model, year, defect summary, consequence summary, corrective summary}`. The summaries from these three columns are combined to create a single document, which is then used for vector embedding.

For this task, a subset of the dataset was selected, focusing on data from Ford and Toyota makes only.

## Implementation
The agent first retrieves relevant documents based on the input (make, model, year, and issue) and then processes them to generate the final summary. The project ensures that the retrieved documents are incorporated into the summary generation process to provide accurate and relevant results.
